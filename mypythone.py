# since day 1
#Pythone is for manupulating memory
 #we started from the memory brain of a comp where we had (harddiscs, ram,cache, andthe buffer)
 #the memory stores things in an ordered way and thats done by partitioning the memory by labeling them 
 #the memory is circular and the cpu accesses memory on using identifiers
 #ram stores the address of te memory
 #cache comes in due to frequent opening of files
 #Pythone was crated by Guido van Rossum
 #Ozzy is representing east africa in pythone
 #pythone came into existence that is there was alanguage called c which represents all languages and so Rossum wanted to
 #to improve that language by creating ab language so during the chris holidays he watched the monty py game 
 #so its where he derived the pythone language amodification of the c language 
 #python apps ( instagram,firefox) its in the fourth generation
 #its also  related to human language andthe comp uses binary language and so how do we transform humanlanguage to binary 
 #that is by interpretation and compilation
 #Rules that govern programmming languages is syntax and the rules that govern the human language is clled the grammer
 #astatement in python is the full instructin in acomputer
 #when you type 10+20 you telling ram to out put it on the screen
  #the memmory has addresses that takes to variables
  #variables are names that programmers give to the memory spaces
  #acode is one or two statements
  #in pythone to create we use declare
  #and to put is to initialise
  #the equalsig is used to give values to the variables
  #the equalsign in math is called the assignment operator
  #our pydatatype in python manages our memory by categorising the content
  #Python has serial datatypes( numerics,strings,map,floats,sets,boolean)
  #strings are for grouping characters and the are always put in quotations
  #variables names should not start with special characters, e.g(#,@,$,*)
  #variable names shouldnot begin with numerical number,e.g(1numder,2number)
#however,number1,number2 is valid syntax
#avariable name shouldnot have spaces, e.g( my name, my age)
#composite names should be seperated by an underscore, e.g(my age, my name)
#or you can use camel-case notation, e.g (myAge,myName)
#names shouldnot start with capital letters unless they sre functions or classes, e.g (Myname
#we should use relatable names e.g when dealing with acustomer, call them mycustomer,when dealing with numbers use num1,num2)
#use shorter names e.g ( cust for customer, age instead of myage)
#variables names shouldnot be repeated in differentt forms because python is case sensetive, e.g(Name and name are not the same)
age=20
name="joan"
gender="female"
print(gender)
#declaring variables is aprocess of naming computer memory spaces
# initialising is aprocess of giving variables avalue, e.g(age is a variable, 26 is its value)
country="uganda"
#the = sign is called the asignment operator in programming language
#Sequence we have unique data in the same memory
#floats (numbers with decimals)
#the first sequence is called alistwe add values using append
#alist is mutable and identified with square brackets 
#ataple is imutable and identified by parenthesis brackets
#in mapping we have the dict , the key ,the value
#finally the operators
