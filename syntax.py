#variable syntax for python (# represents acomment)
#variables names should not start with special characters, e.g(#,@,$,*)
#variable names shouldnot begin with numerical number,e.g(1numder,2number)
#however,number1,number2 is valid syntax
#avariable name shouldnot have spaces, e.g( my name, my age)
#composite names should be seperated by an underscore, e.g(my age, my name)
#or you can use camel-case notation, e.g (myAge,myName)
#names shouldnot start with capital letters unless they sre functions or classes, e.g (Myname
#we should use relatable names e.g when dealing with acustomer, call them mycustomer,when dealing with numbers use num1,num2)
#use shorter names e.g ( cust for customer, age instead of myage)
#variables names shouldnot be repeated in differentt forms because python is case sensetive, e.g(Name and name are not the same)
age=20
name="joan"
gender="female"

#declaring variables is aprocess of naming computer memory spaces
